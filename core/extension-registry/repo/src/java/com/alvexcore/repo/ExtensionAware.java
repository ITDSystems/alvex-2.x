	// We remove required annotation for the moment.
	// We do it to solve circular deps problems (ALV-749 and similar).
	// See OrgchartExtension and OrgchartService for example of the problem:
	// - extension aware service needs extension to set up (typically to create nodes in repo)
	// - repo ops may be called only after bootstrap (RepositoryExtensionRegistry takes care of it)
	// - so, extension needs a ref to service to call it during init()
	// - however, service needs a ref to extension too to call it during setUp()
	// Making this setExtension() not required allows simple unified solution - 
	//    extension just should call setExtension(this) during init()
	// @Required
	public void setExtension(RepositoryExtension extension);
