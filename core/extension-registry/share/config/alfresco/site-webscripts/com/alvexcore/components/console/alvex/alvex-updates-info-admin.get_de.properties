aui.help.issues=<p></p>\n<p>1. Installed version "Missing" means the component was registered but was not actually deployed.</p>\n<p>2. Installed version "Mismatched" means component versions on Repository side and on Share side do not match. This setup may be unstable.</p>\n<p>3. Status "Modified" means you are using a customized version of the component. Most probably it was compiled from sources with some patches that are not supported by Alvex. Therefore it is not safe to update this component to the latest version because you will override these modifications.</p>
